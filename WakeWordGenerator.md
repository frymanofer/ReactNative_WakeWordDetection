Welcome to **Davoice WakeWord / Keywords Detection** – Wake words and keyword detection solution designed by **DaVoice.io**.

# Wake word generator

## Create your "custom wake word""

***Below are the steps you will need to perform in order to generate your custom wake word you will need to***:

- **Create wake word mode:**
    Contact us at info@davoice.io with a list of your desired **"custom wake words"**.

    We will send you corresponding models typically your **wake word phrase .onnx** for example:

    A wake word ***"hey sky"** will correspond to **hey_sky.onnx**.

- **Add wake words to Android:**
    Simply copy the new onnx files to:

    android/app/src/main/assets/*.onnx

- **Add Wake word to IOS**
    Copy new models somewhere under ios/YourProjectName.

    You can create a folder ios/YourProjectName/models/ and copy there there.

    Now add each onnx file to xcode making sure you opt-in “copy if needed”.

- **In React/JS code add the new onnx files to your configuration**
  
    Change:


```javascript

    const instanceConfigs:instanceConfig[] = [
  
      { id: 'need_help_now', modelName: 'need_help_now.onnx', threshold: 0.9999, bufferCnt: 3 , sticky: false },
  
    ];
```
  
To:

    
```javascript  
  
    const instanceConfigs:instanceConfig[] = [
  
      { id: 'my_wake_word', modelName: 'my_wake_word.onnx', threshold: 0.9999, bufferCnt: 3 , sticky: false },
  
    ];
```

For example if your generated custom wake word" is "hey sky":

 
```javascript
    const instanceConfigs:instanceConfig[] = [
  
      { id: 'hey sky', modelName: 'hey_sky.onnx', threshold: 0.9999, bufferCnt: 3 , sticky: false },
  
    ];
```

- **Last step - Rebuild your project**

## About this project

This is a **"wake word"** package for React Native. A wake word is a keyword that activates your device, like "Hey Siri" or "OK Google".

It also provide **Speech to Intent**. **Speech to Intent** refers to the ability to recognize a spoken word or phrase
and directly associate it with a specific action or operation within an application. Unlike a **"wake word"**, which typically serves to activate or wake up the application,
Speech to Intent goes further by enabling complex interactions and functionalities based on the recognized intent behind the speech.

For example, a wake word like "Hey App" might activate the application, while Speech
to Intent could process a phrase like "Play my favorite song" or "Order a coffee" to
execute corresponding tasks within the app.
Speech to Intent is often triggered after a wake word activates the app, making it a key
component of more advanced voice-controlled applications. This layered approach allows for
seamless and intuitive voice-driven user experiences.
